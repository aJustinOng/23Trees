# 2-3 Trees: Applications and Advantages

### Ze Sen Tan and Zhen Ze Ong

This was a group project for a Data Structures & Algorithms class in my Sophomore year of university. It is a basic exploration of the 2-3 Trees data structure, a complex version of binary trees. Looking back, we could have structured the code better and added a proper user interface. The output of the current code is limited to the first two levels of the created 2-3 tree.
